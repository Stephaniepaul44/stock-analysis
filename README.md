Summary: 
The advantages of refactoring code is that you have code to start with and you are not starting from scratch. This can save time if you are able to easily read and refactor the existing code. The disadvantages of refactoring code would be if you are using someone elseâ€™s code and you are unable to read it to refactor it. This can be challenging because there are many different ways to get the same result in coding.
